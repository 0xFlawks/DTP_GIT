#### DAA was the first project to join and use b00ts v2.

This OG project on Solana has created a second collection called Higher Self, which lets you burn your DAA V1 (main collection which was immutable) and get a DAA V2 (which is mutable with royalty ON) with a touch of glow to recognize a V1 and V2.

DAA has therefore worked on over a hundred traits so that you can modify your Ape as you wish. 690 trait packs have been distributed to the 600+ V1 burners.

If you want to change a trait, you need to have an other trait of the same type (body, mouth, eyes..)\
When you'll change a trait, the old one will go directly into your wallet as a SFT.

V2 Collection : [https://www.tensor.trade/trade/daahs](https://www.tensor.trade/trade/daahs)

In the end, the traits will come out over the years to create perpetual demand.\
You have a DAA and you want to try boots -> [https://itsboots.xyz/](https://itsboots.xyz/)
