We raffled and sent **600 Immortals Degen Trash Pandas** to DTP holders having those delisted from marketplaces for 30+ days. We also sent one Immortal per licensed Panda to the wallets holding those.&#x20;

Current circulating supply is 724 and those are tradable on :

* Tensor at [https://www.tensor.trade/trade/immortalpandas](https://www.tensor.trade/trade/immortalpandas)&#x20;
* ME at [https://magiceden.io/marketplace/dtp\_immortals](https://magiceden.io/marketplace/dtp\_immortals)&#x20;

The remaining supply is held in the DTP treasury and there will be a way to acquire those in the future. Those **Immortals Degen Trash Pandas** are immutable but will have an utility in the boofing mechanism.
